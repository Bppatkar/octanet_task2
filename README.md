# Overview

I created a simple and user-friendly To-Do List web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
Users can add tasks, mark them as completed, edit existing tasks, and delete tasks they no longer need. 
The application stores tasks locally, so users can access their lists even after closing the browser. 
It's designed with a clean interface and minimalistic style, making it easy for anyone to organize their tasks efficiently. 
Check out the code and try it out for yourself! #WebDevelopment #ToDoList #JavaScript #HTML #CSS
